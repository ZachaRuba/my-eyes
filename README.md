Helping dyslectics read by using vision and text-to-speech.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

Create a file called '.env' and a folder called 'uploads' in the root folder 

Append API keys from [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/text-to-speech/)

Append API keys from Google Cloud Vision
1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)
2. [Enable billing for your project](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing)
3. [Enable the Google Cloud Vision API API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=vision.googleapis.com)
4. [Set up authentication with a service account so you can access the API from your local workstation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

.env should look like this when you're done:
